Overview
########
``skplatform`` is a software package that provides attitude and pointing solutions for both atmospheric radiation simulations
and real atmospheric optical instruments. Its primary goal is to map look unitvectors emanating from an optical instrument to
look vectors at a geophysical location, which can then be used by radiative transfer code and other software.
